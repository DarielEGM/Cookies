# Cookies! [cookies](https://github.com/DarielEGM/Cookies/assets/123778387/3e42598a-c595-4ddf-ad8b-6cd6a6cc7706)

This project was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The purpose of the application is to create a Cookie where it saves information. It also has a function called getCookie that allows obtaining the information associated with a value by console. Eg: getCookie("user"), which returns the value of 'dalto', and if it does not exist, it returns the message: "There are no cookies with that value". 

Important: The project requires setting up a local server like XAMPP and copying it to the htdocs folder.
